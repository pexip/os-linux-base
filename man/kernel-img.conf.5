kernel\-img.conf \- configuration file for Linux kernel packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The file
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
is used by the kernel package installation and removal process to
allow local options for handling some aspects of the installation.
Most configuration variables apply only to kernel image packages.
.PP
Not all kernel image package creators support this file, or all the
configuration variables.  Support status for the file itself is:
.TS
nokeep;
l	l.
\fBPackage creator\fR	\fBStatus\fR
Debian linux source package	supported
Ubuntu linux source package	supported
kernel\-package	supported
make deb\-pkg	ignored
.TE
.PP
The format of the file is a simple
.IB VAR = VALUE
pair. Boolean values may be specified as
.IR Yes ,
.IR True ,
.IR 1 ,
and
.IR No ,
.IR False ,
.IR 0 ,
and are case insensitive.
This file is automatically created by the installation script in
certain circumstances.
.PP
At the moment, the user modifiable variables supported are:
.TP
.B do_symlinks
If set, the postinst and postrm scripts will maintain symlinks to
default kernel and initramfs images, as described in
\fIlinux\-update\-symlinks\fR(8).  This variable is set by default.
.TS

and overrides any other setting of \fBimage_dest\fR.  This
variable is unset by default.

.B postinst_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Set this variable to a script to be executed during installation. The
path can be a relative path if the script lives in a safe path -- that
is, if it lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be an
absolute path instead. Before calling this script, the environment
variable
.B STEM
shall be set to the value of the
.I \-\-stem
argument (or the default value, linux), and in packages created
by kernel\-package
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package.  This script shall be called with two arguments, the first
being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall cause the
postinst to fail. Since debconf is in use before the script is called,
this script should issue no diagnostic messages to stdout -- while the
postinst does call
.BR db_stop ,
debconf does not restore stdout, so messages to stdout disappear.
An example script for grub users is present in
/usr/share/doc/kernel\-package/ directory.
This script is run
.I after
the scripts in /etc/kernel/postinst.d directory.

.B postrm_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Set this variable to a script to be executed in the postrm (that is,
after the image has been removed) after all the remove actions have
been performed. The path can be a relative path if the script lives in
a safe path -- that is, if it lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or
/usr/sbin, or must be an absolute path instead. In packages
created by kernel\-package, the environment variable
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package. This script shall be called with two arguments, the first
being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall produce a
warning message, but shall be otherwise ignored. Since debconf is in
use before the script is called, this script should issue no
diagnostic messages to stdout --  while the postinst does call
.BR db_stop ,
debconf does not restore stdout, so messages to stdout disappear.
This script is run
.I after
the scripts in /etc/kernel/postrm.d directory.

.B preinst_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Set this variable to a script to be executed before the package is
unpacked, and can be used to put in additional checks. The path can be
a relative path if the script lives in a safe path -- that is, if it
lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be an absolute
path instead. In packages created by kernel\-package, the
environment variable
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package. This script shall be called with two arguments, the first
being the
.I version

.B prerm_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Set this variable to a script to be executed before the package files
are removed (so any added files may be removed) . The path can be a
relative path if the script lives in a safe path -- that is, if it
lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be an absolute
path instead. In packages created by kernel\-package, the
environment variable
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package. This script shall be called with two arguments, the
first being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall cause the prerm
to fail. Since debconf is in use before the script is called, this
script should issue no diagnostic messages to stdout -- while the
postinst does call
.BR db_stop ,
debconf does not restore stdout, so messages to stdout disappear.
This script is run

.B src_postinst_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Unlike the other hook variables, this is meant for a script run during
the post inst of a docs, headers or a source package. Using this hook
for the headers package is now being deprecated, at some point the
headers post install script shall only run the header_postinst_hook.
The path can be a relative path if the script lives in a safe path --
that is, if it lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must
be an absolute path instead. The environment variable
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package.  This script shall be called with two arguments, the first
being the
.I name
of the package being installed (could be kernel source or headers),
and the second argument being the
.I version
of the package being installed. Errors in the script shall cause the
postinst to fail.
This script is run
.I after
the scripts in /etc/kernel/src_postinst.d directory.

.B warn_reboot
This variable can be used to turn off the warning given when
installing a kernel image which is the same version as the currently
running version. If the modules list is changed, the modules
dependencies may have been changed, and the modules for the new kernel
may not run correctly on the running kernel if the kernel ABI has
changed in the meanwhile. It is a good idea to reboot, and this is a
note to remind you. If you know what you are doing, you can set this
variable to no. This variable is set by default.

This option manipulates the build link created by recent kernels. If
the link is a dangling link, and if a the corresponding kernel headers

(YES).

symlinks by default.

.B silent_modules
This option has been put in for the people who are vastly irritated on
being warned about preexisting modules directory
.IR /lib/modules/$version .
That directory may belong to an old or defunct kernel image package,
in which case problems may arise with leftover modules in that
directory tree, or the directory may legitimately exist due to a
independent modules package being installed for this kernel version
that has already been unpacked.  In this latter case the existence of
the directory is benign.  If you set this variable, you shall no
longer be given a chance to abort if a preexisting modules directory
.I /lib/modules/$version
is detected.  This is unset by default.
